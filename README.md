# Overview
I'm weird - I like writing unit tests.  This lil' repo is my exploration of both unit test authoring in Python, as well dealing with string templating.  

# Usage
Clone the repo and run the source (`testing-example.py`) with `python3 testing-example.py` or just `python testing-example.py` at the command line (depending on what version of Python you have installed).

Please note that 2 of the sample tests start off set up to fail to demonstrate the different templating options for failed-test situations.
